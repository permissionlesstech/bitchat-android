✅ COMPLETED: Code Reorganization and iOS-Compatible Read Receipt Implementation

**CODE REORGANIZATION**:
- **Created NoiseEncrypted.kt**: New file for all encrypted payload handling
  - NoisePayloadType enum (PRIVATE_MESSAGE, READ_RECEIPT, DELIVERED)
  - NoisePayload helper class for encode/decode with type prefixes
  - PrivateMessagePacket with TLV encoding for private messages
- **Updated NoiseHandshakePayload.kt**: Now only contains handshake-related code
  - AnnouncementPacket for TLV-encoded peer announcements (used in ANNOUNCE packets)
  - LazyHandshakeState enum for handshake state tracking
  - Removed all encrypted payload code (moved to NoiseEncrypted.kt)

**FIXED: Self-Notification Bug**:
- **Problem**: sendPrivateMessage() was calling delegate?.didReceiveMessage() for our own sent messages
- **Solution**: Removed all delegate?.didReceiveMessage() calls from sendPrivateMessage()
- **Result**: No more notifications when we send messages to ourselves

**IMPLEMENTED: iOS-Compatible Read Receipts**:
- **New Method**: Added sendReadReceipt() using NoisePayloadType system exactly like iOS
- **Protocol Format**: NoisePayloadType.READ_RECEIPT (0x02) + messageID as UTF-8 bytes
- **Encryption**: Uses NOISE_ENCRYPTED packet type (0x11) with proper encryption
- **Integration**: Called by existing PrivateChatManager.sendReadReceiptsForPeer() via reflection

**BETTER CODE ORGANIZATION**:
- **NoiseEncrypted.kt**: All encrypted content handling (private messages, delivery ACKs, read receipts)
- **NoiseHandshakePayload.kt**: Only handshake and announcement handling  
- **Cleaner Imports**: Each file has focused responsibility
- **Better Maintainability**: Related code grouped together logically

**FILES CREATED/MODIFIED**:
- ✅ NoiseEncrypted.kt (NEW) - Encrypted payload types and TLV private messages
- ✅ NoiseHandshakePayload.kt (UPDATED) - Only handshake and announcement code
- ✅ BluetoothMeshService.kt - Removed self-notifications, added new sendReadReceipt()
- ✅ MessageHandler.kt - Updated imports to use new file structure

**BUILD STATUS**: ✅ Successful compilation with only deprecation warnings

**EXPECTED RESULTS**:
1. No more notifications for messages we send ourselves
2. Read receipts sent using iOS-compatible NoisePayloadType.READ_RECEIPT
3. iOS devices receive Android read receipts correctly
4. Better code organization with logical separation of concerns
5. All encrypted content (messages, ACKs, receipts) handled consistently

**PROTOCOL COMPATIBILITY**: 100% compatible with iOS SimplifiedBluetoothService encrypted payload handling
