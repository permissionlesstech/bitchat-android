# android ios protocol noise implementation
BitChat Android iOS Protocol Synchronization Implementation Plan

PHASE 1: Core Protocol Alignment (Priority: HIGH)
1. NoisePayloadType Implementation
   - Create NoisePayloadType enum with privateMessage, readReceipt, delivered
   - Update message handling to embed types within encrypted payloads
   - Modify private message encryption to use payload type prefixes

2. Simplified Message Processing
   - Remove legacy message types from MessageHandler
   - Consolidate all encrypted content into noiseEncrypted handling
   - Update packet routing to match iOS simplified logic

3. TLV Announcement Protocol
   - Verify IdentityAnnouncement TLV encoding matches iOS exactly
   - Update announcement processing in message handlers
   - Test binary compatibility with iOS announcements

PHASE 2: Service Architecture Simplification (Priority: MEDIUM)
4. Consolidate Manager Components
   - Merge complex manager hierarchies into core service methods
   - Reduce from 8 managers to 5 essential collections like iOS
   - Simplify delegate patterns to match iOS publisher/subject model

5. Enhanced Fragmentation
   - Verify fragment handling matches iOS single fragment type
   - Update fragment reassembly for simplified protocol
   - Test large message handling with iOS devices

6. Improved Connection Management
   - Simplify peripheral/central state tracking
   - Match iOS dual-role BLE management
   - Enhance peer mapping and cleanup

PHASE 3: Protocol Features (Priority: MEDIUM)
7. NoisePayload Helpers
   - Implement NoisePayload encode/decode utilities
   - Add payload type validation and error handling
   - Test encrypted payload compatibility with iOS

8. Message Padding Enhancement
   - Verify MessagePadding matches iOS block size logic
   - Test traffic analysis resistance features
   - Ensure optimal block size calculation works correctly

9. Compression Compatibility
   - Fix compression/decompression to work with iOS LZ4
   - Currently disabled - implement proper LZ4 compatibility
   - Test compressed message exchange with iOS

PHASE 4: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)
10. Enhanced Maintenance
    - Implement iOS-style single timer maintenance
    - Consolidate cleanup operations
    - Add peer connectivity checking logic

11. Publisher Integration
    - Add Combine-style publishers for reactive updates
    - Match iOS publisher patterns for UI integration
    - Implement fullPeersPublisher equivalent

12. Performance Optimization
    - Implement iOS-style message deduplication
    - Add efficient memory management
    - Optimize for battery and performance

FILES TO MODIFY:
- MessageHandler.kt (noise payload processing)
- BluetoothMeshService.kt (service simplification)
- PacketProcessor.kt (simplified routing)
- BitchatMessage.kt (noise payload support)
- NoiseEncryptionService.kt (payload type integration)
- BinaryProtocol.kt (compression fixes)
- FragmentManager.kt (single fragment type)
- SecurityManager.kt (simplified security)

TESTING PRIORITIES:
1. Basic announcement exchange with iOS
2. Private message encryption/decryption
3. Fragment handling for large messages
4. Connection stability and peer discovery
5. Protocol compatibility validation
