✅ COMPLETED: iOS-Compatible Read Receipts and Self-Notification Bug Fix

**FIXED: Self-Notification Bug**
- **Problem**: When sending private messages, Android was calling `delegate?.didReceiveMessage()` for our own sent messages, causing notifications for messages we sent ourselves
- **Root Cause**: In `BluetoothMeshService.sendPrivateMessage()`, both success and failure paths called `delegate?.didReceiveMessage()` with our own message
- **Solution**: Removed the `delegate?.didReceiveMessage()` calls from sendPrivateMessage() - the UI handles showing sent messages through its own logic
- **iOS Compatibility**: iOS doesn't send didReceiveMessage for self-sent messages - only for received messages

**IMPLEMENTED: iOS-Compatible Read Receipts**
- **New Implementation**: Added `sendReadReceipt()` method using NoisePayloadType system exactly like iOS
- **Protocol Format**: Uses `NoisePayloadType.READ_RECEIPT` (0x02) + messageID as UTF-8 bytes
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the payload and sends as `NOISE_ENCRYPTED` packet (type 0x11)
- **Method Signature**: `sendReadReceipt(messageID: String, recipientPeerID: String, readerNickname: String)`
- **Integration**: Method is called by existing `PrivateChatManager.sendReadReceiptsForPeer()` via reflection

**Technical Implementation**:
```kotlin
// Create read receipt payload using NoisePayloadType exactly like iOS
val readReceiptPayload = NoisePayload(
    type = NoisePayloadType.READ_RECEIPT,
    data = messageID.toByteArray(Charsets.UTF_8)
)

// Encrypt and send as NOISE_ENCRYPTED packet
val encrypted = encryptionService.encrypt(readReceiptPayload.encode(), recipientPeerID)
val packet = BitchatPacket(type = NOISE_ENCRYPTED, payload = encrypted, ...)
```

**Files Modified**:
- BluetoothMeshService.kt - Removed self-notifications and added new sendReadReceipt()
- NoiseHandshakePayload.kt - Already contains NoisePayloadType.READ_RECEIPT definition
- MessageHandler.kt - Already handles READ_RECEIPT decoding in handleNoiseEncrypted()

**Build Status**: ✅ Successful compilation with only deprecation warnings

**Expected Result**: 
- No more notifications for messages we send ourselves
- Read receipts sent using iOS-compatible NoisePayloadType system
- Both delivery ACKs and read receipts work through same encrypted channel
- Perfect iOS-Android read receipt interoperability

**Testing Points**:
1. Send private message from Android - should not trigger self-notification
2. Receive private message on Android while viewing chat - should send read receipt
3. iOS should receive Android read receipts correctly via NoisePayloadType parsing
